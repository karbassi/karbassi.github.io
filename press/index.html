                    <p>In episode 340, I chat with Ali Karbassi the founder of We All Code. He talks about why he fell in love with coding, why doing what you love now matters more than figuring it out for life, why he didn't want to just talk about diversity in tech, he wanted to do something about it, why comments make people think they're not good at things, getting kids to code early and how to figure out if they are having a hard time with it or just not liking it, plus his tips on how to start a non profit.</p>
